# Firmware Preparation

A collection of C-style coding exercises and solutions focused on embedded systems and firmware development.

## About
This repository showcases practical problem-solving in C, with an emphasis on embedded concepts, data structures, and low-level programming. Each module is self-contained and demonstrates:
- Efficient, idiomatic C code
- Embedded systems best practices
- Attention to performance and resource constraints

## Topics Covered
- Data structures (e.g., circular buffers)
- Bit manipulation
- Memory management (no dynamic allocation)
- Real-world embedded scenarios
